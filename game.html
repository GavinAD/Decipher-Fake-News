      <h1>About Our Game</h1>
      <p>"Don’t Be Fooled: Deciphering Fake News" is an interactive quiz game that is<br>
            geared towards teens who use social media regularly, and, more specifically,<br>
            receive their news from social media platforms. Players are guided through a series of<br>
            true and false questions, which they answer by tilting a thumb remote.<br>
            Is it actually true or actually false? Don’t be fooled!
      </p>

      <p>The controller for the game detects the users motion.  The user moves the<br>
         controller up or down based on how they wish to respond.  This gives the user<br>
         a more immersive experience to pressing buttons on a keyboard or controller.
      </p>
      <h3>How Our Game Works</h3>
      <p>Hover over the "Fake News" bubble and click the arrow pointing up.  Notice what happens to the other bubbles. <br>
         Then, do the same for the "DON'T BE FOOLED" bubble, and once again notice how our game affects the overall problem.
